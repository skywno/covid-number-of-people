# covid-number-of-people
As part of social distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19, gym facilities, restaurants, and various event venues are currently subject to capacity restrictions. However, some public facilities, including gyms, do not have the infrastructure to share information about the number of people and the status of facility use with the public in real-time, which causes inconveniences such as making direct contact with the facility.

This project was started to relieve some of these inconveniences. Corona queue service helps visitors easily view public facility information, check current events, admission capacity, and the number of people, and decide whether to visit. The place manager directly manages the information of the place
